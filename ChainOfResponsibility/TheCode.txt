How It Works:
1.	Alarm Request Object (StationAlarmsRequest)
	•	Represents a station’s alarms, including the time, station name, request ID, and a list of alarms.
2.	Base Handler (BaseStationAlarmsHandler)
	•	Defines a generic alarm processing structure with a Handle method.
	•	Can set the next handler using SetNext(), creating a chain of handlers.
	•	Passes unhandled alarms to the next handler in the chain.
3.	Concrete Handlers (Specialized Teams)
Each team extracts and processes alarms matching specific conditions:
	•	StationSupplyTeam → Handles alarms containing "Low Product".
	•	MaintenanceTeam → Handles alarms containing "High Temperature".
	•	SupportTeamStationAlarmsHandler → Handles alarms containing "Tcp Error".
	•	DeveloperTeamStationAlarmsHandler → Handles alarms containing "Memory Leak".
4.	Alarm Processing (AlarmList)
	•	A custom list class that allows extracting and removing alarms matching a condition.
5.	Client Code (Setting Up the Chain)
	•	The handlers are linked using SetNext(), forming a processing chain.
	•	The request starts at StationSupplyTeam, which processes relevant alarms and forwards the rest down the chain.
	•	Each handler only processes alarms it is responsible for and then passes the request along.
